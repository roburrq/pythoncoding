    What benefit does NAT64 provide?
        It allows sites to use private IPv6 addresses and translates them to global IPv6 addresses.
        It allows sites to connect multiple IPv4 hosts to the Internet via the use of a single public IPv4 address.
        It allows sites to connect IPv6 hosts to an IPv4 network by translating the IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses.*
        It allows sites to use private IPv4 addresses, and thus hides the internal addressing structure from hosts on public IPv4 networks.
    What is the effect of configuring the ipv6 unicast-routing command on a router?to assign the router to the all-nodes multicast group
    to enable the router as an IPv6 router*
    to permit only unicast packets on the router

    An administrator is trying to remove configurations from a switch. After using the command erase startup-config and reloading the switch, the administrator finds that VLANs 10 and 100 still exist on the switch. Why were these VLANs not removed?These VLANs are default VLANs that cannot be removed.
    These VLANs cannot be deleted unless the switch is in VTP client mode.
    These VLANs can only be removed from the switch by using the no vlan 10 and no vlan 100 commands.
    Because these VLANs are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory, this file must be manually deleted.*

        OSPFv3 routers use a different metric than OSPFv2 routers use.
        OSPFv3 routers use a 128 bit router ID instead of a 32 bit ID.
        OSPFv3 routers do not need to elect a DR on multiaccess segments.
        OSPFv3 routers do not need to have matching subnets to form neighbor adjacencies.*

        Cost equals bandwidth.

        Switch(config-if)# no switchport trunk allowed vlan 100
        Switch(config)# no vlan 100*
    What is the purpose of setting the native VLAN separate from data VLANs?
        The native VLAN is for carrying VLAN management traffic only.
        The security of management frames that are carried in the native VLAN can be enhanced.
        A separate VLAN should be used to carry uncommon untagged frames to avoid bandwidth contention on data VLANs.*
        The native VLAN is for routers and switches to exchange their management information, so it should be different from data VLANs.

        The access list defines the valid public addresses for the NAT or PAT pool.
        The access list defines the private IP addresses that are to be translated.*
        The access list prevents external devices from being a part of the address translation.
        The access list permits or denies specific addresses from entering the device doing the translation.
    Match the order in which the link-state routing process occurs on a router. (Not all options are used.)

    As part of the new security policy, all switches on the network are configured to automatically learn MAC addresses for each port. All running configurations are saved at the start and close of every business day. A severe thunderstorm causes an extended power outage several hours after the close of business. When the switches are brought back online, the dynamically learned MAC addresses are retained. Which port security configuration enabled this?

    Which characteristic describes cut-through switching?
    Frames are forwarded without any error checking.*
    Error-free fragments are forwarded, so switching accurs with lower latency.
    Buffering is used to support different Ethernet
    speeds.
    Only outgoing frames are checked for errors.

    Correct answer here differs from your practice Final exam online. The correct answer there is “Only outgong frames are checked for errors.”. Just thought I’d point that out.

    in the v6 exam, add some questions to here and as well as the test online. also, remove dupes for test online.

    DHCP process steps need to be added to the test online. #90
    #89 needs two answers, not just one. also for the test online.

    new question: (paraphrased) network engineer is checking a config implemented by an intern for an ip phone switchport. ID the issue, if any:
    r()# vlan 2222
    R()# name voice
    r()# int f0/20
    r()# switchport mode access
    r()# mls qos trust cos
    r()# switchport access vlan 2222
    r()# end

    options:
    config is correct
    (answer found somewhere in a comment) spanning tree BDU guard feature is missing

    there were some other suggestions for answers. the official exam would not let me get item feedback for the correct answer. just took it tonight
